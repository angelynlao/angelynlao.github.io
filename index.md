		I am a Full Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and serve as the Director of the <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/censer/" target="_blank">Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER)</a> at the College of Science, De La Salle University (DLSU). Additionally, I am a member of the <a href="https://dlsu-scomb.github.io/" target="_blank">Systems and Computational Biology (SComB) Research Unit</a> under CENSER, as well as the <a href="https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)</a> within the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing, and Networking (AdRIC) Research Center at the College of Computer Studies, DLSU. My research interests encompass Systems Biology, Graph Theory, and Mathematical Modeling.

I transitioned to DLSU following the completion of my Doctorate in Systems Biology from the Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at the University of Rostock in Germany. I earned both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Mathematics at DLSU. From 2018 to 2023, I held two Professorial Chairs in Mathematics: the Br. C. John Lynam FSC Professorial Chair and the Br. Albinus Peter FSC Professorial Chair. Additionally, I served as the Assistant Dean for Research and Advanced Studies (ADRAS) in the College of Science at DLSU from 2017 to 2023.

I utilized mathematical modeling to tackle pressing health issues in the Philippines, including Alzheuner's disease, tuberculosis, insulin resistance, and antimicrobial resistance. My research also encompasses epidemic modeling and health communication dynamics to assist policymakers in optimizing the timing and effectiveness of information dissemination through social media. My research endeavors leverage my mathematical expertise to devise practical solutions for societal improvement.
