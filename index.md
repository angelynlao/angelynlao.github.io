		I am a Full Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the director of the <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/censer/" target="_blank">Center for Natural Sciences and Environmental Research (CENSER)</a>, College of Science, DLSU. I am also a member of the of the <a href="https://dlsu-scomb.github.io/" target="_blank">Systems and Computational Biology (SComB) Research Unit</a> under CENSER and the <a href="https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)</a> of the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing, and Networking (AdRIC) Research Center, College of Computer Studies, DLSU. My research interests are Systems Biology, Graph Theory, and Mathematical Modeling.

		I joined DLSU after the completion of my Doctorate in Systems Biology under the <a href="https://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/team/detail/dr-angelyn-lao" target="_blank">Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (SBI)</a> at the University of Rostock (Germany). I obtained my BS and MS degree in Mathematics at DLSU. I held two Professorial Chairs in Mathematics namely the Br. C. John Lynam FSC Professorial Chair in Mathematics and the Br. Albinus Peter FSC Professorial Chair in Mathematics during 2018-2023. I was also the Assistant Dean for Research and Advanced Studies (ADRAS) of the College of Science at <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/" target="_blank">De La Salle University (DLSU)</a> from 2017 to 2023. Several of my most notable publications include my work on establishing mathematical and compartmental models to describe and analyze biological and signaling pathways associated with different diseases. I also apply mathematical and computational models to study epidemic spreading of diseases and health communication dynamics. My recent works apply mathematics to study and discover the patterns in the topological structures of different networks/graphs.
